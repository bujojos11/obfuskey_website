## Why do you have to?

Well, you don't. This is purely on a voluntary basis. The whole thing is free but if you feel like it is something that you could have paid for, if you feel like this a project you want to participate in or simply if you feel like you have some change to spare, then feel free to tip the project.

## What are the tips going to be used for?

Currently, everything (development, hours of documentation writing, domains purchase etc) has been paid for out of pocket and this has not brought any financial strugle, let's be clear with that. This started as a hobby project for personal use and then because I wanted to share it, I realized I have to write a lot of documentation, make this website etc.

While I don't expect many new feature to be published because, by definition, the beauty of this project is its simplicity, I can't say that it won't take any more of my time.

So if you support the project, you will basically participate in:
- paying for the rent (domains)
- paying for past hours of development and writing
- paying for futur developments, if any
- in the eventuality that web3 would finally happen for real, paying for the domain names could happen directly from the project's wallets via a smart contract but I wouldn't hold my breathe for it ...

One of my goal would be to use the project's wallet as a bounty for the brute-forcing of the obfuscation, to motivate people into proving me wrong but I unfortunately don't have the finances to set the bounty by myself so if you support the project, you will also participate in setting up the bounty because the project's wallet is the bounty.
